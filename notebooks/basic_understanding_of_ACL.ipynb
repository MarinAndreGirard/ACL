The interaction term is given by $H_I=X\\otimes H^e_I$ with $H^e_I=E_IH_r+E^0_I$ and $X$ the position operator and $H_r$ is a random matrix. this makes the interaction strenght dependant on the position. The environment self Hamiltonian is given by $H_e=E_eH_r'+E^0_e$, with $H_r$ another random matrix. These random matrices are fixed at the beginning with two seed for re-running a similar simulation and are importantly independantly selected.
