(Code will be added by May 15th. This project will be based on code that has already been written for a personnal project of mine, once adapted it will be added to this repro.)

This repository contains an open-source quantum decoherence model implemented using Qutip, to simulate the Adapted Caldeira-Legget model and provide a suite of tools for studying quantum decoherence phenomena.


# Overview

Quantum decoherence is a crucial concept in quantum mechanics, describing the process by which a quantum system loses coherence due to interactions with its environment. The ACL model is a very useful toy model for stying the phenomena from a theoretical and numerical framework.

This repository offers a computational implementation of the ACL model using Qutip. Alongside the simulation, it provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for analyzing and visualizing decoherence processes, with the goal of being a one-stop shop for people wanting to generate numerics using the ACL model.

# Features

ACL Model Simulation: Generate unitary evolution of an interacting system + environment depending on relavant ACL parameters.

Analyze the effects of decoherence: visualize apparent collapse, capture Schmidt states convergence to Pointer states, see splitting of total energy eigenspaces, VN entropy growths, ...

Visualization Tools: See the dynamics of your system via generation of videos.

Modular Design: The codebase is designed with modularity in mind, allowing easy extension and customization for specific research needs.

Documentation and Examples: Comprehensive documentation and example scripts are provided to facilitate usage and understanding of the model and its capabilities.


# How to clone and use this model will be detailed once it is usable.
